# Medical-Bill-Prediction-using-AdaBoost-Regressor

In this project, out goal is to make prediction on the medical bill given the features.

I read the dataset using pandas and then proceed to find any missing data. I then proceed to perform exploratory data analysis and find any missing outliers and proceed the drop them.

I split the data into training and testing part. I use the AdaBoost Regressor machine learning model for this project. I tune the hyperparameters inorder to get the best results.
 
I further import mean absolute error and eman squared error in order to test the predictions made by the machine learning model.
